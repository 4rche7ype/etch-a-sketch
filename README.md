This is a lesson/project from TheOdinProject.com

In this project a default grid of 16 x 16 evenly sized squares are generated.

Originally, the user could hold down the left mouse button while moving the cursor around and "paint" a square black.

Now, the user can hold down the left mouse button and drag the cursor around to "paint" the squares a randomly generated color.

Additionally, each time a square is passed into by the cursor while the left mouse button is held down, the opacity is increased by .1 until 1 is reached.

There is also a purposefully big button that when pressed will trigger a prompt and ask the user for a new size for the grid.

After entering a valid number up to 100 it will generate the new grid of the appropriate size i.e. 50 will generate a 50x50 grid.

This small project is mainly to showcase what I have learned thus far which includes flex-box and DOM manipulation through javascript.
